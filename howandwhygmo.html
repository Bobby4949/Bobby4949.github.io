    <h2>How are GMOs made?</h2>
       <p class="p1">There are five main ways gmos are made: Traditional breeding, Mutagenesis, RNA interference, Transgenics and Gene editing. The lines between these methods are not very clear, but here is a general description of each method.
</p>
        <p class="p2" >1.	Traditional breeding, this method of genetic engineering was used to create the vast majority of foods us humans consume nowadays. The crops known as the eight founder crops of agriculture: Flax, Emmer wheat, Einkorn wheat, Barley, Lentil, Pea, Chickpea and Bitter vetch, are all products of this ancient method. This method involves selectively breeding plants with desired traits to create offspring with similar traits, this method takes a long time to actually make a usable plant but is quite effective. This method like all other method on this list, also works on animals.</p>
           
        <p class="p3">2.	Mutagenesis, this method works by introducing mutations in the organisms genome. At first, a method called Random Mutagenesis was used, this method involved exposing plants to chemicals and radiations which caused random mutations in it’s genome, hench the name. Because of the random nature of Random Mutagenesis, scientists looked for new methods such as Site-Directed Mutagenesis, which widely uses PCR (I will link a video by The Thought Emporium), a sub-variant of Site-Directed Mutagenesis is Combinatorial mutagenesis. Other methods considered or can be used for Mutagenesis are Homologous recombination, CRISPR and Gene synthesis. A crop produced by mutagenesis is Ruby Red grapefruits.</p>
           
        <p class="p4"> 3.	RNA interference, this method is able to switch off/silence targeted genes. This can be used to remove any junk genes a organism may have (believe me, there is a lot of them). During RNA-I, long dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) is cut/”diced" into small fragments around 21 nucleotides long by the “Dicer” enzyme. These small fragments, referred to as small interfering RNAs (siRNA), bind a special family of proteins called the “Argonaute proteins”. After binding, one strand of the dsRNA is removed, leaving the remaining strand available to bind to messenger RNA target sequences according to the rules of base pairing: A binds U, G binds C, and vice versa. Once bound, the Argonaute protein can either cleave the messenger RNA, destroying it, or regulate the target sequence in other ways, thus “switching off” the RNA”. Scientists have found that potato plants can be protected from Colorado potato beetle using this method.
           </p>
           
           
        <p class="p5"> 4.	Transgenetics, despite sounding like a gene version of transhumanism, is actually the name of method of genetic engineering that artificially inserts genes of other organisms into an organism. The soil-bacterium, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, is able to do this by itself in nature, it is a plant parasite. In fact, Agrobacterium tumefaciens is so good at its job it is used in Transgenetics. </p>
           
        
    <p class="p6">5.	Gene editing, this method involves the insertion, deletion or replacement of DNA. There are many methods used in Gene editing, the three main ones are ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR. I will link a specific website that explains how these three methods works and their pros and cons as I could not hope to summarise it nearly as good.
