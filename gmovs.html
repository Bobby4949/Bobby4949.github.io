           <h2>GMO:</h2>
           
           <h2>PROS:</h2>
           <p class="p1"> 1. Far more precise than selective breeding, so less waste and less time. 2. Due to fear and being a new tech, GM foods are actually intensively checked and monitored by several different agencies and groups before use. 3. The average GM is not any more dangerous than the average Organic confirmed after thousands of studies and decades of research. I strongly encourage you to find your own evidence and compare them. Remember, only taking one side of the argument is not good science. 4. Does not need pesticide as it makes them itself, for reference; from your broccoli to that tree in the park, every plant on earth today makes pesticides. Coffee can act as an insect pesticide, yet humans drink it daily. It’s like how chocolate is dangerous to dogs and toxic to parrots, but the only danger it poses to humans is its high sugar levels. 5. GMO can save much space, time, energy, resources, and more. It is capable of being one of the most excellent tools in the fight against global warming. GMs can make pesticides obsolete as they are very capable of handling any pests themselves. GMs can also protect themselves from deadly microbial and viral infections, saving entire industries, such as when GM papaya, which was naturally vaccinated against the Ringspot virus, saved the Hawaiian papaya industry in 1992 from an economic disaster. 6. Potential for highly nutritious GMs with more variations. 7. Potential for GMs that can be grown without regard to climate, so inhospitable zones can produce a more varied food supply. There will also be higher yields as seasons no longer affect production rates; this also removes the need for costly greenhouses. 8. Potential for far more self-sufficient crops, which can, for example, draw nitrogen from the air by themselves using bacteria genes, this removes the need for fertilizer overuse which protects the environment from, for instance, nitrogen build-ups. 9. It is possible to modify plants to use up a large amount of Carbon Dioxide, which can slow down global warming.</p>
           
           
           <h2>CONS:</h2>
           <p class="p1"> 1. Gene flow where traits of GM crops leak into regular crops through breeding. 2. Terminator seeds (sterile seeds to prevent gene flow). 3. Toxic GMs made on purpose to resist pests. 4. Concerns about long-term effects. 5. Resistance to pesticides can be harmful as companies that make pesticides can sell more pesticides and incentivize farmers to use only one type of pest. 6. Is more complex/more expensive than selective breeding. 7. Allergies may be caused. </p>
           
           
           <h2> Rebuttal against the pros of GMO: </h2>
           <p class="p1"> 1. GM may be more precise, but not everyone can do it. The research may also be more expensive. 2. There are fears over the long-term effects of GMs over decades and generations. 3. GMO can be monopolized by large corporations such as Monsanto. </p>
           
           <h2>Rebuttal against the Rebuttal</h2>
           <p class="p1">
           
           The main issues with GMs are A. Expenses, B. Monopolisation. Both are real issues, but neither is any fault of GMs. If anything, the technology should be more widespread and better funded. It is the current Farming industry that has to change, not GMOs. GMOs will not affect your genes; it is safe. Pretty much any GMO has had only a small portion, usually only a couple strands of genes edited. There is nothing that should and nothing that can hurt you.
           
           </p>
           
           
           <h2>Rebuttal against GM cons:</h2>
           <p class="p1">
           1. Gene flow isn’t that bad if the plant is indeed safe or superior to regular foods; besides, not growing the same/similar species right next to each other should prevent this. 2. Don’t make/ban terminator seeds; there are other ways of dealing with gene flow, e.g., as mentioned, buffer zones (these can even be made out of other crops. 3. Toxic GMs are not toxic to humans; different toxins affect different things, penicillin, for example, is a toxin released by the penicillium fungi to kill competing bacteria and fungi, yet without this toxin, humans would be plagued by far more diseases. 4. Pesticide problems can be efficiently dealt with by not making pesticide-resistant GMs and focus on GMs that produce their own pesticides. Besides, a large amount of criticism such as this one against GMs is criticisms against the farming industry in general, which is no fault of the GMs nor the technologies despite being valid, correct, and essential. 5. The risk of allergies is dumb, so are most allergies. An allergy is caused when the immune system is triggered by a foreign substance. It is known that long-term exposure to anything from early childhood can prevent allergies. Any allergy-related concerns will disappear after several years if everyone chooses to eat GM foods.

           <h2>Organic:</h2>
           <h2>PROS:</h2>
           <p class="p1">
           1. uses compost/manure. 3. uses less pesticide than conventional foods and natural organic pesticide used. 4. feels right. 5. organic farming has been done for thousands of years. 6. known for sure to be safe without pesticides. 7. might taste better according to a youtube comment.
           
           </p>
           
           
           <h2>CONS:</h2>
           <p class="p1">1. more expensive to buy than conventional and GMO foods. 2. takes up far more land for the same crop yield. 3. can require vast greenhouses and electricity. 4. higher greenhouse emissions. 5. fraud, conventional foods labelled as organic. 6. People are fanatical over Organic and hating GMs, falling victim to tribalism</p>
           
           <h2>Rebuttal:</h2>
           <p class="p1"> 1. GMO can also use compost. 2. There are still pesticide residues present. An organic pesticide can be just as toxic, if not more toxic, than conventional pesticides. GMOs don’t need pesticides if done correctly. 3. Even if buying organic feels right, it is no better than even conventional foods. It’s just another production method. 4. Organic farming has been done for thousands of years and is known to be safe without pesticides, but it needs pesticides.</p>
           
           <h2>Rubuttal against rebuattal:</h2>
           
           <p class="p1">
           1. Organic foods can be grown by anyone, which may cut costs. 2. Can also require less electricity depending on the scale of manufacture. 3. Even though it requires pesticides, give Organics a good wash should remove most of the already small amount of pesticides present.

           <p class="p1"> I tried to put together a fair comparison but it's 2:07 AM and I have bais, I strongly recommend doing your own research as it's good scientific method, also, the video I've linked is not by me, it is by once again Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell, but you can find pro GMO information from every major science source as well as every major science youtube channel, e.g. Scishow, Real Science, Thought Emporium and more!</p>
