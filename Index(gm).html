       <p class="p1">GMO is short for Genetically Modified Organisms, generally speaking any modern-day crop is a GMO crop, since humans have selectively breed crops with traits we want e.g., bigger fruit. Take this Corn crop for example:</p>
            <div class="corn"></div>            
            <p class="paragraph2">This wild corn (Teosinte) is far different from what we eat today. However, that is not what we mean by GMOs when we talk of them now. Today what should be considered as GMO is disputed, but it is roughly along the lines of organism altered in a way that "does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination." GMOs are an essential technology and the most significant leap in the field of Agriculture yet. It is a technology that is highly controversial and has caused several heated debates and even movements. In one case in 2013, farmers in the Philippines attacked fields of Golden rice testing sites owned by the Government and uprooted 1000 square meters of GMO Golden rice. Golden rice is a rice variant aimed to increase carotene in people's diets, especially in poorer countries, as lack of carotene is currently one of the highest killers of children worldwide. According to UNICEF, Vitamin A deficiency puts 140 million children at risk of illness and death per year. If Golden rice is so good, why do people destroy it? People are afraid of GMs because they do not understand GMs, as well, as it is easy to view GMs like abominations of science, this easily formed fear is capitalized by sellers of "fresh and organic" products, and so the misconceptions spread further. Scientists, doctors, and the vast majority of people in the scientific community, however, commonly agree on the fact that GMs are no more dangerous than non-GMO foods; even the Non-GMO Project is unable to tell you that GMOs are not safe.

What is the histroy of GMO? The first GMOs were made by early humans using crossbreeding and selective breeding to bring out the desirable traits in food and animals; this type of Gene Modification resulted in most of the food we eat today; this has been happening ever since Circa 8000 BCE, which was about 10,000 years ago.
It was only in 1866 when the basic process of genetics was identified by an Austrian monk, in the 1940s, not long before the first nuclear bomb was created and exploded in a New Mexico desert, scientists began using radiation to bombard plants and mutate them, the results were unpredictable.
Genetic engineering all began to change upon the identification of DNA structure in 1953 by James Watson and Francis Crick, who built on the legendary and underappreciated Rosalind Franklin, who used X-rays to take Photo 51, allowing the discovery. 
Soon enough, in 1973, Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen develop genetic engineering when they managed to insert DNA from one type of bacteria into another.
In 1982 finally, the first consumer GMO product was approved by the FDA.
