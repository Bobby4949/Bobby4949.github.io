       <p>I am a Minecraft enthusit that have been playing non-stop ever since 2014, I have spent countless hours watching turtorials and testing minecraft mechanics in-game. 
        In the game itself, I specialise in building, but I have a bit of knowledge in aspects such as:
        <ul>
        <li>redstone.</li>
        <li>mechanics and automation.</li>
        <li>commands</li>
        </ul>
        
            
        <p> In my free time I like to watch youtube and browse reddit, I espically enjoy minecraft content by Scicrafters such as Ilmango. Of course minecraft isnt my only interest, others include:
        <ul>
        <li>Tolkien's legendarium</li>
        <li>The Stormlight Archieve</li>
        <li>Starwars</li>
        <li>science in general</li>
        <li>social sciences such as geograhpy</li>
        <li>Warhammer 40k (this one is relativily new)</li>
        </ul>
